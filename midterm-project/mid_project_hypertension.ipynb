    "In this notebook, we aim to predict the risk of hypertension for individuals based on various health parameters. Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition that significantly increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. The goal of this study is to build a machine learning model that can effectively classify individuals as being at risk for hypertension. We will follow the standard process of data analysis, which includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and selection."
