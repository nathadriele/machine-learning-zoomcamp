## Ford Car Price Prediction

![cars](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a824a8-7dfd-4b88-8823-b12a75ed9f18)

### Problem Description

Determining the right selling price is vital for used car sellers—be it dealerships or individual owners. Pricing too low leads to lost profits, while pricing too high deters potential buyers. This project uses Machine Learning to predict used Ford car prices based on attributes like year, mileage, fuelType, and more. The project also explores a binary classification approach (e.g., “Is the price above/below a certain threshold?”) to show additional metrics and insights.

**Key goals:**

Prevent underpricing and overpricing.
Provide data-driven valuations for Ford vehicles.
Offer a scalable, reproducible solution via EDA, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and a Flask (Docker/Kubernetes) deployment.
